# Forms

[Forms](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) are fundamental to design and web applications. It is the way we gather data from users.

## Task

Create a simple website that has a minimum of three pages: a homepage, a registration form, and a login form. Your website will be limited, since there is no application logic to actually "do" anything when a user registers or logs in. We will address this in future projects.

## Resources

[W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp), [web searches](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/search?q=forms&restrict_sr=on), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web), and Chapter 7 of your book (it's really good!!).

## Learning Goals
By the end of this project, you should be familiar with several elements and attributes:

- `form` element
- `input` element
- `label` element
- (there are many more elements relevant to forms)
- `type` attribute
- `action` attribute
- `target` attribute
- (there are many more attributes relevant to forms)
